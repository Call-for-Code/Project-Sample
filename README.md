# Project Title

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [한국어](README.ko.md), [português](README.pt_br.md).*

One or two paragraphs of project description goes here. Talk about the scope of the problem that you are addressing and include any relevant NGO definitions of existing goals or initiatives. Describe the impact of the problem on human lives and the wellbeing of communities.

Then explain the anticipated or proven impact of your solution, and explaining in particular the novel or innovative advantage this has over existing solutions that make it attractive to developers and users (such as potential customers).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instnance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

```bash
echo "This is so different, you should put your own here."
```
